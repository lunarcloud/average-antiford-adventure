== T_G_C_Ch_W_W ==
You work hard to keep up. Fixing watch after watch. As your pile of completed watches begins to grow, the cheering becomes in your favor. You may have had a slow start, but you begin to vastly outpace the machine. Even your boss begins to pat you on the back as you work.

Some time passes, and you need to check your progress. You can either keep up your pace, and finish the watches you have. Or you can add some flare to the watches that you have. That could end really well. Or you can check on how that machine is doing.
