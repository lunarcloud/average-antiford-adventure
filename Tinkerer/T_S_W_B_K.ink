You decide you have come this far, and you should really insure that this is the design you want to test before continuing. After some food, you decide that you could really change the way a few of your parts work so that you can make it faster and more efficient.

So you begin your work. Changing things and re arranging some parts. At the end, you smile wide. It looks amazing! It is late at night, and you know you have spent your day well.

It is time... you insure it gets put together and you decide it is time to test it.
