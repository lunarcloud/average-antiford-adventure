You decide to take your time. You are still wworking, and any product you finish will certaintly be sold. So you take your time and begin work. You work hard, and items are getting out fast. However, before you know it, the whistle is blown and you jump. You have only three lenses completed, and you frown as you see the machine has completed twelve.

Your cowowrkers sighs and frown, however when Marx checks them over, he finds a flaw in the machine which has caused a few of its lenses to be damaged. An easy fix, however this is something he did not know about the machine. He claims the machine's seven completed and perfect lenses still beat your three, but he does not punish you for the mistake. He orders everyone back to work while he tries to fiddle with the machine.

Weeks past, and you didn't lose your job until many of your coworkers were let go. Another store-wide compitition is held and you are sick and miss out. You are fired days later, with a substantial severance package.
End Result: You Lose
-> END
