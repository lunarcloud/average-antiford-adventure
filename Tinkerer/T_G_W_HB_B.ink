You roll your eyes, and return to your workshop. You are too old for this.

You settle down and continue working. You finish that project, yay.

After a few more projects, your day is done and you head home.

You have survived another day. As you go home and sit next to your significant other, you realize you must wake up and go through it all tomorrow.
End Result: You neither Win, Nor Lose.
-> END
