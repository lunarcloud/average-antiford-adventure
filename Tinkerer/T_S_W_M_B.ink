You decide to get that book. Looking for it for a great amount of the day, you eventually find it.

Looking through it, you find that there are a great deal of interesting tips on "going without" as far as parts go. In fact, some of your ideas are validated in the book, you found out that you even did certain things better. However, some of the ideas are perfect for your invention, and you even see where you went wrong with one part.

After making a few quick fixes, you go and eat as a break. When you return, you are so excited, you decide you should just go and test your invention. However, you should really second guess your work. You've already found some issues. Maybe relooking it over could help.
