So you run around the counter, and chase them out of the store, yelling. Clocks and gadgets are falling from the Captain's shirt, and even his fake mustache falls off in the chase. They head out the door and careen down the street. Your old lungs will not carry you, and you frown. It looks, however, that the Doctor has left a note outside on the curb, with some money. They money by no means can make up for the amount in stolen property, but it covers the repair and a few items.

So you grab it and give it to the counter worker, who has come outside. You tell him to get the constable, and to ring up the transaction so Marx won't find out too bad.

The counter boy mentions it was dumb of him to tell them his name. You look at him like he is stupid.
