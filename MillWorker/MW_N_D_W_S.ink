You decide your food is enough to avoid the foreman of the break room. So, you find a seat, sit down, and begin eating your meal. Instantly you can almost feel the relief of your body. It feels great!

As you are finishing your mini feast, you see your foreman scanning the room, and spotting you he makes his way over to you. You sigh, but say nothing as he approached.

He expresses disappointment at your work, and he needs some more workers back on that station during this break period. He suggests it will be a good way for you to make up for the rest of the days disappointments. You understand you haven't been anywhere near your best for the day, but giving up your break period could be a big toll on you for the rest of the day.
