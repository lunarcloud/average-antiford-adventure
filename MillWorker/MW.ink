That's right, you are a Mill Worker. How could you forget. You go to your drawer and put on your overalls. The new "denim" material feels alien on your skin. They claim it will be more resilient to the rough conditions of mill work, but you are unsure.

After pulling on the new clothes, you grab your food rations and look them over. Not very much. Should you eat some now for breakfast? However, you know you will be tired later... and you should really save the meal for later.

Should you eat some breakfast? or save it for later?
