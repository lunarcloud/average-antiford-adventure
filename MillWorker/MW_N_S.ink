You can't help yourself. You calmly take a step towards him and reach into his bag, grabbing a fruit. Stepping back, you notice that everyone else in the car doesn't appear to have taken notice of you. And even as you begin to eat the fruit, nobody says anything. However, the man whose fruit you have stolen catches the sound of you eating fruit, and when he turns to look at you, you look away quickly, trying to pretend you do not notice. He checks his bag, and his face goes from dead-tired look of a corpse to a suddenly animated face of rage.

He yells at you, accusing you of stealing his food. You deny it, shaking your head and claiming innocents. He walks up to you and takes the fruit out of your hand. You swallow what you have got. Before the train can stop, he has began to beat you up inside the cart, leaving you as a crumpled mess on the floor when it pulls into the station and everyone walks out. You muster up your courage, but as you leave the train you realize he has taken your satchel of food with him, and now you have a black eye and you are starving.
